A web app that allows the user to upload a photo and then detects and highlights any faces in that photo. It also requires users to register and sign in and keeps a record of how many photos they have uploaded.

**Server Code:** https://github.com/nathan-bark/face-recognition-api

## Tech Stack

**Client:** React

**Server:** Node, Express

**Database:** PostgreSQL

**Node Packages:** React Hook Form, Clarifai, Particles-bg, Tachyons, React Tilty


I chose to use React because it is something I am trying to develop my skills in and it gives a clearer progression through the app thanks to the component structure.

Express was my choice for the server as it was my first attempt at using a server and I wanted something that was relatively simple and lightweight to use but also fast and versatile.

I used React Hook Form to manage my forms because it integrates smoothly with react and is relatively simple to use.
## Lessons Learned

I gained a clearer understanding of how React works and about the file structure within React Apps. I also increased my knowledge of React Hooks and how to implement them.

At first I had problems getting React Hook Form to work as I wanted, but after studying the documentation and a little experimentation the process became clear.
